So, yes, the tube shapes and interfaces have been designed to make the bike as aerodynamic as possible, but the Speedmax CF SLX 9.0 LTD also has tuned the geometry to help the rider get into an aero position that is not only accessible and comfortable, but has a longer wheelbase that aids in keeping the bike stable in cross winds, and agile while cornering.',
